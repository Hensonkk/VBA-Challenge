# VBA-Challenge
This is a repo for VBA-Challenge in Module 2. 
  It is a VBA Script that loops through and analyzes data on each worksheet in the Multiple Year Stock Data excel file. 

  
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
-The ticker symbol
-Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
-Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
